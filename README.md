## Hey, I'm Marcin Zielonka ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer in Akamai Technologies. I am also a BEng graduate at Computer Science at the Faculty of Computer Science, Electronics and Telecommunications at AGH UST.

Apart from work and studies, I have been also involved in [BIT Scientific Research Group](http://fb.com/knbit) where I was a President of whole organisation and former head of [BIT Java](https://github.com/BIT-Java) where I was giving lectures for students about everything connected with Java - the basics of programming, good coding practises, libraries and frameworks (especially Spring Boot).

### What I'm focusing on ðŸ”¥

Continuously improving Java skills related to Spring Framework and AuthN/AuthZ. Also amazingly fascinated with microservices architecture, its good practices, and recent trends. Trying to do my best by creating web applications using ReactJS or Angular 10+, too ðŸ˜‰

### Open-Source! ðŸ¥³

Currently, I am mainly focusing on the project [Fluqxverse](https://github.com/mzlnk/fluqxverse) where I building consistent and reliable microservice architecture based on JVM using latest technologies and approaches (some tutorials in form of articles on Medium are on their way, too ;)).

As an enthusiastic Java and Spring Boot Developer I'm creating some tutorials and starters which are open to use!

- [OAuth2 Exchange](https://github.com/mzlnk/oauth2-exchange)
- [Multi Tenancy OAuth Resource Server Spring Boot Starter](https://github.com/mzlnk/multi-tenant-oauth2-resource-server-spring-boot-starter) (Archived)
